## OGPD (Online Gambling Promotion Detector)
In the current digital era, social media has become the primary platform for disseminating various types of information, including harmful online gambling information. The spread of online gambling information via social media has become a serious issue that requires effective handling because it can negatively impact the community's morals and mental health.

In response to this challenge, this study implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify content related to online gambling on social media platforms. The objective is to develop an accurate classification system and present the results in an easily interpretable form to support decision-making by authorities. The urgency of this research lies in the need for an effective tool to detect and prevent the increasingly troubling spread of online gambling information.

To achieve this goal, the SVM algorithm with an RBF kernel was applied to a dataset consisting of 42,623 social media posts, with 20.3% positive content (containing online gambling information) and 79.7% negative content.

The model evaluation results showed a classification performance with an accuracy rate of 96.91%. Specifically, the model has high precision and recall for the negative class, each at 97% and 99%, respectively, with an F1-score of 98%, while for the positive class, the model's precision is 98%, recall is 87%, and F1-score is 92%.

These findings indicate that the developed SVM model is highly effective in identifying and distinguishing online gambling-related content from normal content. The implementation of the research results is realized in the form of an interactive website capable of collecting, classifying, and displaying classification results along with data visualizations, including label distribution, word frequency, and word clouds.
